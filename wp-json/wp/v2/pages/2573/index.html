This galaxy is the eponymous member of the NGC 691 galaxy group, a group of gravitationally bound galaxies that lie about 120 million light-years from Earth.&nbsp; Objects such as NGC 691 are observed by Hubble using a range of filters. Each filter only allows certain wavelengths of light to reach Hubble\u2019s WFC3. The images collected using different filters are then coloured by specialised visual artists who can make informed choices about which colour best corresponds to which filter. By combining the coloured images from individual filters, a full-colour image of the astronomical object can be recreated. In this way, we can get remarkably good insight into the nature and appearance of these objects.

width=\"1165\" height=\"611\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The two main choices in the above model are (1) the existence and size of an endowment pool, and (2) the existence of a permanently growing linear supply, as opposed to a capped supply as in Bitcoin. The justification of the endowment pool is as follows. If the endowment pool did not exist, and the linear issuance reduced to 0.217x to provide the same inflation rate, then the total quantity of ether would be 16.5% less and so each unit would be 19.8% more valuable. Hence, in the equilibrium 19.8% more ether would be purchased in the sale, so each unit would once again be exactly as valuable as before. The organization would also then have 1.198x as much BTC, which can be considered to be split into two slices: the original BTC, and the additional 0.198x. Hence, this situation is&nbsp;<em>exactly equivalent<\/em>&nbsp;to the endowment, but with one important difference: the organization holds purely BTC, and so is not incentivized to support the value of the ether unit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The permanent linear supply growth model reduces the risk of what some see as excessive wealth concentration in Bitcoin, and gives individuals living in present and future eras a fair chance to acquire currency units, while at the same time retaining a strong incentive to obtain and hold ether because the &#8220;supply growth rate&#8221; as a percentage still tends to zero over time. We also theorize that because coins are always lost over time due to carelessness, death, etc, and coin loss can be modeled as a percentage of the total supply per year, that the total currency supply in circulation will in fact eventually stabilize at a value equal to the annual issuance divided by the loss rate (eg. at a loss rate of 1%, once the supply reaches 26X then 0.26X will be mined and 0.26X lost every year, creating an equilibrium).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that in the future, it is likely that Ethereum will switch to a proof-of-stake model for security, reducing the issuance requirement to somewhere between zero and 0.05X per year. In the event that the Ethereum organization loses funding or for any other reason disappears, we leave open a &#8220;social contract&#8221;: anyone has the right to create a future candidate version of Ethereum, with the only condition being that the quantity of ether must be at most equal to&nbsp;<code>60102216 * (1.198 + 0.26 * n)<\/code>&nbsp;where&nbsp;<code>n<\/code>&nbsp;is the number of years after the genesis block. Creators are free to crowd-sell or otherwise assign some or all of the difference between the PoS-driven supply expansion and the maximum allowable supply expansion to pay for development. Candidate upgrades that do not comply with the social contract may justifiably be forked into compliant versions.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net\/b9b2b9d84e4f91a755031b6fb8e2d7d2a21b65ea\/1d3d9\/static\/2c0e5e27e397f4ac6b88082fd28d072f\/c1b63\/ether-state-transition.png\" alt=\"Ether state transition\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Galaxycoin&nbsp;state transition function,&nbsp;APPLY(S,TX) -&gt; S&#8217;&nbsp;can be defined as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Check if the transaction is well-formed (ie. has the right number of values), the signature is valid, and the nonce matches the nonce in the sender&#8217;s account. If not, return an error.<\/li><li>Calculate the transaction fee as&nbsp;STARTGAS * GASPRICE, and determine the sending address from the signature. Subtract the fee from the sender&#8217;s account balance and increment the sender&#8217;s nonce. If there is not enough balance to spend, return an error.<\/li><li>Initialize&nbsp;GAS = STARTGAS, and take off a certain quantity of gas per byte to pay for the bytes in the transaction.<\/li><li>Transfer the transaction value from the sender&#8217;s account to the receiving account. If the receiving account does not yet exist, create it. If the receiving account is a contract, run the contract&#8217;s code either to completion or until the execution runs out of gas.<\/li><li>If the value transfer failed because the sender did not have enough money, or the code execution ran out of gas, revert all state changes except the payment of the fees, and add the fees to the miner&#8217;s account.<\/li><li>Otherwise, refund the fees for all remaining gas to the sender, and send the fees paid for gas consumed to the miner.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, suppose that the contract&#8217;s code is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>if !self.storage[calldataload(0)]:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.storage[calldataload(0)] = calldataload(32)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that in reality the contract code is written in the low-level EVM code; this example is written in Serpent, one of our high-level languages, for clarity, and can be compiled down to EVM code. Suppose that the contract&#8217;s storage starts off empty, and a transaction is sent with 10 ether value, 2000 gas, 0.001 ether gasprice, and 64 bytes of data, with bytes 0-31 representing the number&nbsp;2&nbsp;and bytes 32-63 representing the string&nbsp;CHARLIE.The process for the state transition function in this case is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Check that the transaction is valid and well formed.<\/li><li>Check that the transaction sender has at least 2000&nbsp;*&nbsp;0.001 = 2 ether. If it is, then subtract 2 ether from the sender&#8217;s account.<\/li><li>Initialize gas = 2000; assuming the transaction is 170 bytes long and the byte-fee is 5, subtract 850 so that there is 1150 gas left.<\/li><li>Subtract 10 more ether from the sender&#8217;s account, and add it to the contract&#8217;s account.<\/li><li>Run the code. In this case, this is simple: it checks if the contract&#8217;s storage at index&nbsp;2&nbsp;is used, notices that it is not, and so it sets the storage at index&nbsp;2&nbsp;to the value&nbsp;CHARLIE. Suppose this takes 187 gas, so the remaining amount of gas is 1150 &#8211; 187 = 963<\/li><li>Add 963&nbsp;*&nbsp;0.001 = 0.963 ether back to the sender&#8217;s account, and return the resulting state.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If there was no contract at the receiving end of the transaction, then the total transaction fee would simply be equal to the provided&nbsp;GASPRICE&nbsp;multiplied by the length of the transaction in bytes, and the data sent alongside the transaction would be irrelevant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that messages work equivalently to transactions in terms of reverts: if a message execution runs out of gas, then that message&#8217;s execution, and all other executions triggered by that execution, revert, but parent executions do not need to revert. This means that it is &#8220;safe&#8221; for a contract to call another contract, as if A calls B with G gas then A&#8217;s execution is guaranteed to lose at most G gas. Finally, note that there is an opcode,&nbsp;CREATE, that creates a contract; its execution mechanics are generally similar to&nbsp;CALL, with the exception that the output of the execution determines the code of a newly created contract.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-white-color\">Code Execution<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The code in Galaxycoin&nbsp;contracts is written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode language, referred to as &#8220;Galaxycoin&nbsp;virtual machine code&#8221; or &#8220;EVM code&#8221;. The code consists of a series of bytes, where each byte represents an operation. In general, code execution is an infinite loop that consists of repeatedly carrying out the operation at the current program counter (which begins at zero) and then incrementing the program counter by one, until the end of the code is reached or an error or&nbsp;STOP&nbsp;or&nbsp;RETURN&nbsp;instruction is detected. The operations have access to three types of space in which to store data:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The&nbsp;<strong>stack<\/strong>, a last-in-first-out container to which values can be pushed and popped<\/li><li><strong>Memory<\/strong>, an infinitely expandable byte array<\/li><li>The contract&#8217;s long-term&nbsp;<strong>storage<\/strong>, a key\/value store. Unlike stack and memory, which reset after computation ends, storage persists for the long term.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The code can also access the value, sender and data of the incoming message, as well as block header data, and the code can also return a byte array of data as an output.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The formal execution model of EVM code is surprisingly simple. While the Galaxycoin&nbsp;virtual machine is running, its full computational state can be defined by the tuple&nbsp;(block_state, transaction, message, code, memory, stack, pc, gas), where&nbsp;block_state&nbsp;is the global state containing all accounts and includes balances and storage. At the start of every round of execution, the current instruction is found by taking the&nbsp;pc-th byte of&nbsp;code&nbsp;(or 0 if&nbsp;pc &gt;= len(code)), and each instruction has its own definition in terms of how it affects the tuple. For example,&nbsp;ADD&nbsp;pops two items off the stack and pushes their sum, reduces&nbsp;gas&nbsp;by 1 and increments&nbsp;pc&nbsp;by 1, and&nbsp;SSTORE&nbsp;pops the top two items off the stack and inserts the second item into the contract&#8217;s storage at the index specified by the first item. Although there are many ways to optimize Galaxycoin&nbsp;virtual machine execution via just-in-time compilation, a basic implementation of Galaxycoin&nbsp;can be done in a few hundred lines of code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-white-color\">Blockchain and Mining<\/span><\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net\/fb65642f0dffd1f4bac90dca887e8e3fe724a011\/a0bf9\/static\/479308517ae57f0198f0a43f893884c3\/c1b63\/ethereum-apply-block-diagram.png\" alt=\"Ethereum apply block diagram\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Galaxycoin&nbsp;blockchain is in many ways similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, although it does have some differences. The main difference between Galaxycoin&nbsp;and Bitcoin with regard to the blockchain architecture is that, unlike Bitcoin(which only contains a copy of the transaction list), Galaxycoin&nbsp;blocks contain a copy of both the transaction list and the most recent state. Aside from that, two other values, the block number and the difficulty, are also stored in the block. The basic block validation algorithm in Galaxycoin&nbsp;is as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Check if the previous block referenced exists and is valid.<\/li><li>Check that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the referenced previous block and less than 15 minutes into the future<\/li><li>Check that the block number, difficulty, transaction root, uncle root and gas limit (various low-level Galaxycoin-specific concepts) are valid.<\/li><li>Check that the proof of work on the block is valid.<\/li><li>Let&nbsp;S[0]&nbsp;be the state at the end of the previous block.<\/li><li>Let&nbsp;TX&nbsp;be the block&#8217;s transaction list, with&nbsp;n&nbsp;transactions. For all&nbsp;i&nbsp;in&nbsp;0&#8230;n-1, set&nbsp;S[i+1] = APPLY(S[i],TX[i]). If any application returns an error, or if the total gas consumed in the block up until this point exceeds the&nbsp;GASLIMIT, return an error.<\/li><li>Let&nbsp;S_FINAL&nbsp;be&nbsp;S[n], but adding the block reward paid to the miner.<\/li><li>Check if the Merkle tree root of the state&nbsp;S_FINAL&nbsp;is equal to the final state root provided in the block header. If it is, the block is valid; otherwise, it is not valid.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The approach may seem highly inefficient at first glance, because it needs to store the entire state with each block, but in reality efficiency should be comparable to that of Bitcoin. The reason is that the state is stored in the tree structure, and after every block only a small part of the tree needs to be changed. Thus, in general, between two adjacent blocks the vast majority of the tree should be the same, and therefore the data can be stored once and referenced twice using pointers (ie. hashes of subtrees). A special kind of tree known as a &#8220;Patricia tree&#8221; is used to accomplish this, including a modification to the Merkle tree concept that allows for nodes to be inserted and deleted, and not just changed, efficiently. Additionally, because all of the state information is part of the last block, there is no need to store the entire blockchain history &#8211; a strategy which, if it could be applied to Bitcoin, can be calculated to provide 5-20x savings in space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A commonly asked question is &#8220;where&#8221; contract code is executed, in terms of physical hardware. This has a simple answer: the process of executing contract code is part of the definition of the state transition function, which is part of the block validation algorithm, so if a transaction is added into block&nbsp;B&nbsp;the code execution spawned by that transaction will be executed by all nodes, now and in the future, that download and validate block&nbsp;B<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Galaxycoin&nbsp;state transition function,&nbsp;APP &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"\" href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Home<\/span> \u67e5\u770b\u5168\u6587 &raquo;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2573"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2573"}],"version-history":[{"count":20,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2573\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2655,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2573\/revisions\/2655"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2573"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
